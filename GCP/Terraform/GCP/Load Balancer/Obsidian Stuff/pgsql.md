### 🔹 How This Template Works
- **Frontmatter**: `links:` array automatically lists the main “Obsidian Stuff” pages this note references.  
- **Inline Links**: Each section has placeholders to link to specific notes in your “Obsidian Stuff” project (like VM setup, architecture diagrams, IAM roles).  
- **Images & Attachments**: Example shows how to embed a diagram directly from the “Obsidian Stuff” subfolder.  
- **Comments Page**: Built-in link to a centralized Comments note where you or your team can add discussion points.  
- **Page References**: There’s a place to record PDF manual pages as well.

### 🔹 Using It in Obsidian
1. Save the above text as `Load Balancer Template – Obsidian Stuff.md` in your `Templates` folder.  
2. Ensure your “Obsidian Stuff” project folder exists with the referenced notes or create them as placeholders.  
3. Insert this template into any new note with `Ctrl/Cmd + P` → “Insert template.”

Would you like me to also **build a matching “Obsidian Stuff Index” note** so all those linked pages already exist and are pre-populated? (Then you can just click through from the template.)
