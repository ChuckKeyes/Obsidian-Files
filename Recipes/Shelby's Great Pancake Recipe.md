Great! Here's a simple step-by-step method to mix your pancake ingredients based on your list:

**Pancake Batter Mixing Instructions**

Step 1**: Combine Dry Ingredients**

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the following:

* 2 cups of flour

* 3 tablespoons of sugar

* 4 teaspoons of baking powder

I recommend using just 1 tsp)

½ teaspoon of baking soda

Step 2: **Combine Wet Ingredients**

In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, mix:

 2 eggs

 ¼ cup of vegetable oil

1½ cups of milk

½ teaspoon of vanilla extract

Whisk until the mixture is smooth and the eggs are fully incorporated.

Step 3: **Mix Wet Into Dry**

 Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.

 Pour the wet mixture into the well.

 Gently stir with a spoon or spatula **until just combined**. The batter should be a little lumpy — **do not overmix**, or the pancakes may turn out tough.

Step 4: **Cook**

Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat.

Lightly grease with butter or oil.

Pour ¼ cup of batter per pancake onto the skillet.

Cook until bubbles form on top and the edges look set (about 2–3 minutes), then flip and cook the other side for 1–2 minutes.

Let me know if you want variations like blueberry, banana, or chocolate chip pancakes! 🍫🍌🫐
